* Version 1.12.5 (unreleased)

** oathtool: The --counter parameter now supports larger values.
Before it used an 'int' type and now it uses a 'longlong' type.
Needed for eSecuTech tokens as they use a 64-bit value for their
initial counter.  Reported by <cameron.bradley@wiretap.net.nz> see
<https://savannah.nongnu.org/support/?108114>.

** Added gnulib self-tests.

* Version 1.12.4 (released 2012-06-17)

** liboath: Usersfile code handles multiple lines for a single user.
This can be used when a single user carries multiple tokens (with
different OATH secrets) and any of them should be permitted.
Suggested by Tim Eggleston <lists@timeggleston.co.uk>.

* Version 1.12.3 (released 2012-05-31)

** pam_oath: Fix "try_first_pass".
Patch from Christian Hesse <list@eworm.de>.

* Version 1.12.2 (released 2012-04-04)

** liboath: usersfile function now works on FreeBSD.
Reported by Fredrik Lindgren <fredrik@lindgren.pp.se>.

** tests: liboath usersfile self-test is skipped if there is no datefudge.
Reported by Fredrik Lindgren <fredrik@lindgren.pp.se>.

* Version 1.12.1 (released 2012-04-01)

** liboath, oathtool: Base32 decoding now permit lowercase characters.
Reported by Martin Michlmayr <tbm@cyrius.com>.

** oathtool: Added --base32 parameter to decode base32 keys.
Suggested by Martin Michlmayr <tbm@cyrius.com>.

** oathtool: Verbose output (-v) now print key data in base32 format too.

** liboath: Added base32 functions.  Added hex encoding function.
The new APIs are oath_bin2hex, oath_base32_decode, and
oath_base32_encode.

** liboath: Gnulib's snprintf is used for better portability.
The system snprintf is known to have bugs on some systems, see the
Gnulib manual for more information.

** API and ABI is backwards compatible with the previous version.
oath_bin2hex: New function.
oath_base32_decode: New function.
oath_base32_encode: New function.
OATH_INVALID_BASE32: New error code.
OATH_BASE32_OVERFLOW: New error code.

* Version 1.10.5 (released 2012-01-03)

** Build fixes.
From Linus Nordberg <linus@nordberg.se> and Arno Hautala
<arno@alum.wpi.edu>.

** Update gnulib files.

* Version 1.10.4 (released 2011-08-12)

** liboath: Fix build so that OATH_VERSION_NUMBER is actually defined.
It was an empty value in the last release due to a bug in the build
scripts.

* Version 1.10.3 (released 2011-08-12)

** liboath: Allow strcmp callback to return negative to signal errors.
Patch by Daniel Pocock <daniel@pocock.com.au>.

** Fix bugs in build scripts for generating version numbers.

** Update gnulib files.

* Version 1.10.2 (released 2011-06-12)

** liboath: Fix self tests to cope with slow build hosts.
Reported by Christoph Egger <christoph@debian.org> in
<http://bugs.debian.org/630222>.

* Version 1.10.1 (released 2011-06-12)

** liboath: Fix self tests to work regardless of local time zone.

** Update gnulib files.

* Version 1.10.0 (released 2011-05-24)

** liboath: Added new TOTP validation functions that return search position.
Before the absolute value of the search position was in the return
code of the TOTP validate function, but it seems we need to know
whether the search position was before or after the current time.  The
new functions are oath_totp_validate2 and oath_totp_validate2_callback
and behave the same asoath_totp_validate and
oath_totp_validate_callback, respectively, but they take another
optional 'int*' parameter to store the search position.

** liboath: Usersfile can now validate TOTP as well.
Supported algorithms are HOTP/T30/D and HOTP/T60/D where D is 6, 7, or
8 digits.  This means that the PAM module now supports TOTP as well.

* Version 1.8.2 (released 2011-05-04)

** build: Fix conflict between ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS and AC_CONFIG_MACRO_DIR.
Reported by Mitya <mitya@cargosoft.ru>.

* Version 1.8.1 (released 2011-05-03)

** build: Make autoreconf work again.
Reported by Christian Hesse <list@eworm.de>.

* Version 1.8.0 (released 2011-05-03)

** liboath: Add new APIs oath_strerror and oath_strerror_name.
The functions are used to get a human readable description of liboath
error codes.  Suggested by Christian Hesse <mail@eworm.de>.

** liboath: Self-tests improvements.

* Version 1.6.4 (released 2011-05-01)

** liboath: Increase usersfile max secret length to 32 bytes.
Reported by Mitya <mitya@cargosoft.ru>.

** oathtool: Support --window together with --totp.

** pam_oath: Re-add the pam_sm_setcred function and make it return success.
Apparently the function need to exist even if it is not used.
Reported by Christian Hesse <list@eworm.de>.

** pam_oath: Link to -lpam for PAM symbols.
Reported by Mitya <mitya@cargosoft.ru>.

** pam_oath: Don't install pam_oath.la file.
Reported by Mitya <mitya@cargosoft.ru>.

** build: Use pammoddir automake variable instead of overriding libdir.
Reported by Mitya <mitya@cargosoft.ru>.

** build: Make autoreconf work in released tar archives.
Reported by Mitya <mitya@cargosoft.ru>.

* Version 1.6.3 (released 2011-04-25)

** pam_oath: Work under SSH by no-op'ing the setcred function.
Reported by Fanis Dokianakis <fanis@infloop.gr>.

** build: Fix srcdir != builddir issues.
Patches from Linus Nordberg <linus@nordberg.se>.

** build: Gnulib files were updated.

* Version 1.6.2 (released 2011-03-10)

** pam_oath: Add ./configure --enable-root-tests parameter.
Now this configure parameter is needed to run the self-tests that
needs root permission.  The fix in the last release was apparently not
sufficient.  Reported by Jean-Michel Pouré - GOOZE <jmpoure@gooze.eu>.

* Version 1.6.1 (released 2011-02-22)

** pam_oath: Improve reliability of root self test when /etc is not writable.
Reported by Jean-Michel Pouré - GOOZE <jmpoure@gooze.eu>.

* Version 1.6.0 (released 2011-02-22)

** liboath: Added APIs to perform TOTP validation.
The APIs are oath_totp_validate and oath_totp_validate_callback,
similar to the corresponding HOTP functions.

** liboath: The function type oath_hotp_validate_strcmp_function was
** renamed to oath_validate_strcmp_function.
It is used by both HOTP and TOTP validation.  The old name will
continue to work through a compatibility-#define.

** oathtool: Support TOTP validation.

* Version 1.4.6 (released 2011-02-07)

** liboath: Improve portability by using more gnulib modules.
Some non-portable constructions were fixed.  From now on gnulib will
warn for some non-portable constructs.

** Fix some minor clang warnings.

* Version 1.4.5 (released 2011-01-27)

** liboath: Make sure gnulib files are licensed under the LGPLv2.1+.
Thanks to Tollef Fog Heen <tfheen@debian.org>.

* Version 1.4.4 (released 2011-01-27)

I forgot to increment these symbols for the last release.  From now
on, these symbols are generated from the package version instead.

** oathtool: Fix typo in man page.
Patch from Linus Nordberg <linus@nordberg.se>.

* Version 1.4.3 (released 2011-01-20)

** liboath: Really make usersfile logic for '-' passwords work.
Reported by Michael Stevens <mstevens@etla.org>.

** pam_oath: Added better self-test suite (requires root privileges).

* Version 1.4.2 (released 2011-01-16)

** oathtool: Really replace - with \- in man page, pointed out by lintian.
We now also have a self check to catch any regressions in this area.

** liboath: Make TOTP self check work on platforms with 32-bit time_t.
The final test requires >32 bit time_t.

* Version 1.4.1 (released 2011-01-16)

** liboath: New configure parameter --enable-gcc-warnings.
Use to enable many compiler warnings.  Enabled by default during
development.

** oathtool: Replace - with \- in man page, pointed out by lintian.

* Version 1.4.0 (released 2011-01-15)

** liboath: Added pkg-config script.

** liboath: Support time-variant TOTP based on draft-mraihi-totp-timebased-07.
New function oath_totp_generate.  New symbols
OATH_TOTP_DEFAULT_TIME_STEP_SIZE and OATH_TOTP_DEFAULT_START_TIME for
default system parameters.

** liboath: New API oath_hotp_validate_callback().
Used when you are validating hashed OTPs.  Inspired by discussions
with Daniel Pocock <daniel@pocock.com.au>.

** oathtool: New parameter --totp to generate time-variant TOTP's.
New sub-parameter --time-step-size, --start-time and --now used to
specify TOTP configuration.

** liboath: Added self-tests of validate functions.

* Version 1.2.2 (released 2011-01-01)

** Cleanups related to name change.

* Version 1.2.1 (released 2010-12-28)

** liboath: Install header file "oath.h".
And various other namespace cleanups.

* Version 1.2.0 (released 2010-12-27)

** Project renamed from "HOTP Toolkit" to "OATH Toolkit".

** liboath: The header file is "oath.h" and library is "liboath.so".
Functions were renamed, but functionality is retained so updating code
is a matter of changing the symbol names only.

** oathtool: Renamed from "hotptool".  Added --hotp flag (the default).
This is to plan for the future when the tool will also support TOTP/OCRA.

** pam_oath: Renamed from pam_hotp.

* Version 1.0.1 (released 2010-12-27)

** libhotp: Fix build failure due to missing sys/stat.h include on FreeBSD 7.2.
Reported by Kevin Quinlan <Kevin.Quinlan@polidoris.com>.

** libhotp: Make usersfile logic for '-' passwords work.
Reported by Rick van Rein <rick@openfortress.nl>.
